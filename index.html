        <strong>CESAR SALAD</strong>

        <strong>INGREDIENTS</strong>

        <ul>
            <l1>1/2 cup high-quality extra virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing </l1>
            <l2>4 cloves garlic, minced</l2>
            <l3>1 baguette, preferably a day old, thinly sliced</l3>
            <l4>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice (plus more to taste)</l4>
            <l5>4 ounces Parmesan cheese, grated</l5>
            <l6>1 teaspoon anchovy paste, or 1 to 2 anchovies, minced</l6>
            <l7>2 large eggs</l7>
            <l8>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (or to taste)</l8>
            <l9>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (or to taste)</l9>
            <l10>4 to 6 small heads romaine lettuce, rinsed, patted dry, wilted outer leaves discarded</l10>

        </ul>

        <strong>PREPARATION</strong>

        <ol>
            <l1>1- Combine the olive oil and garlic:
                In a very large bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup olive oil and garlic. Let sit for at least half an hour.</l1>

            <l2>2- Make the toasted croutons:
                While the garlic is sitting, make the croutons. Spread the baguette slices out on a baking sheet. (You may need to do in batches.)
                
                Brush or spray with olive oil (or melted butter). If you want garlicky croutons, dip pastry brush in the garlic infused oil you have sitting in Step 1.
                
                Broil for a couple of minutes until the tops are lightly browned. (Note: do not walk away, these can easily go from browned to burnt.) Remove and let cool.
                
                The steps up until this point can be made ahead.</l2>

            <l3>3- Make the dressing:
                Add minced anchovies (or anchovy paste, if using) and eggs to the oil-garlic mixture. Whisk until creamy. Add salt and pepper and 1/4 cup of lemon juice. Whisk in half of the Parmesan cheese. Taste, add more lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste. The lemon should give an edge to the dressing, but not overwhelm it.</l3>
                
            <l4>4- Tear off the chunks of romaine lettuce:
                Using your hands, tear off chunks of lettuce from the heads of romaine lettuce (do not use a knife to cut). Add to the dressing and toss until coated. Add the rest of the Parmesan cheese, and toss.</l4>
                
            <l5>5- Combine and serve:
                Coarsely chop the toasted bread into croutons and add to the salad. Brush in any crumbs from chopping the bread, too. Toss and serve immediately.</l5>
                
        </ol>
